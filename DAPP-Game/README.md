# DAPP Game

***This repository contains the code for a simple "Rock Paper Scissors" game written in Solidity and deployed on Blockchain. The aim of the game is to show that how we can create and play games and use blockchains for different purposes.*** 

***How this game works is that there are two players namely "Player-1" and "Player-2". Each player is assigned some ehter coins on the Test Network. Each player makes one move corresponding to which the other player makes it's move. To make a move each player selects that what is the move they want to move i.e. 0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors and the gas they want to spend ex. 10 ether.*** 

***Once this is done, each player makes a move. A simple logic in the smart contract decides that which conditions are satisfied and which player won the match or if it got draw. Based on the result of the match, the winning player gets the coins of the bid from the other player. This goes on till one of the player goes bankrupt and hence the player cannot bid anymore.***
