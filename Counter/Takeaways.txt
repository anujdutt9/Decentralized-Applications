Takeaways:

1. Etherium Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized virtual machine that can run crypto economically secured bits of code called smart contracts.
2. Smart Contracts are written in Solidity language as it is tailored to the etherium blockchain since it comiles down to bytecode specific for Etherium's stack machine.
3. Solidity is Turing Complete i.e. it can run any kind of task, theoretically.
